The biggest difference I noticed between Standard and Incognito mode is that Incognito mode doesn't give you the option to view history or cookies.
The nature of Incognito mode is to keep them from being stored on your computer in the first place, therefore keeping the sites you visit from tracking you.
This would be a great asset for testing. For example, "Will your website function the same without cookies or history?","If it doesn't, how badly is performance compromised without them?", "Is your website easily navigable without the history tracking login data or cookies tracking searches?", "Is it possible to implement a fix that allows the site to function normally when switching between Standard mode and Incognito?", etc.
As for why anyone may want to use something like Incognito mode, one reason is pretty straight forward; no one likes ads. We accept them, they are part of our economic culture but no one really enjoys them. Knowing that a retailer can track our online searches in an effort to bombard us with targeted advertising is annoying at best, creepy and potentially dangerous at worst. Scarcely a week goes by that we don't hear about some online retailer or social media giant and their latest data breach that exposed the private data of millions of it's users, some data that the users didn't even know they had. Incognito mode isn't perfect but it's better than going about the Internet while letting every website peak inside your head, figuratively speaking.
